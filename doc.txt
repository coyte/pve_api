This script is using the API system available with proxmox 6.7 if I remember correctly (Available in version 7 that's for sure).

What you need to feed is the host info and API credentials.
pve="HOST_FQDN_OR_IP"
node="HOSTID"
port=":8006"
vmid="VMID"
apiu="user@realm"
apip="USER_PASSWORD"

First, you need to create an account to use the API system.
Datacenter > Permissions > API Tokens
then add your user. this is your API credentials.
https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_VE_API

The script is creating a ticket to run an action.
The action is defined by $url_end
url_end="nodes/$node/qemu/$vmid/status/stop" (in this case that action will stop the VM $vmid)

If your API user has the proper permission you can run whatever you want as long as it is listed here:
https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/index.html
another example: nodes/{node}/status/reboot (this will reboot your host)

the base URL for your API is always the same https://HOSTIP:8006/api2/json
It is what comes after that will tell the system what it has to do.

The last bit will basically grab in the ticket what is required to be able to trigger the API action.

In summary, this is how it works. Your API user allows you to get a ticket, this ticket will have the necessary information to trigger the API action requested as long as your user has the right permissions.

You can run this from any device. I use it on my laptop to wake up/reboot/shut down VM on my workstation.
But you can also run this from your cellphone. With an app sending HTTP POST requests.
It's a little bit more complicated because you need a token. But it's working fine.
